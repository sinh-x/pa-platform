# pa-platform

Runtime-neutral core library and adapter foundation for PA agent-team workflows.

`pa-platform` extracts shared PA state, API, CLI, registry, ticket, bulletin, document, health, codectx, signal, team, and primer logic into `packages/pa-core`. Runtime adapters such as `cpa` and `opa` can then provide execution hooks without duplicating core behavior.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---|---|
| `@pa-platform/pa-core` | Runtime-neutral PA core library, shared CLI dispatcher, and Agent API app |

## CLI

The Nix package installs a `pa-core` CLI wrapper:

```bash
pa-core teams
pa-core board --project pa-platform
pa-core registry list
pa-core ticket list --project pa-platform
pa-core status
```

Execution commands are deliberately adapter-hooked:

```bash
pa-core deploy builder --mode daily
pa-core serve
```

Without an adapter hook, these return explicit errors instead of invoking a runtime directly.

## Shared State

By default, `pa-core` uses the same on-disk workflow state as old `pa`:

| State | Default path |
|---|---|
| AI usage home | `~/Documents/ai-usage` |
| Registry DB | `~/Documents/ai-usage/deployments/registry.db` |
| Tickets | `~/Documents/ai-usage/tickets` |
| Bulletins | `~/Documents/ai-usage/bulletins` |
| Deployments | `~/Documents/ai-usage/deployments` |

Platform-specific config is separate:

```text
~/.config/sinh-x/pa-platform/config.yaml
```

## Development

```bash
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm build
nix flake show --no-write-lock-file
```

Fish completions are installed by the Nix package and maintained in `completions/pa-core.fish`.

## Branch Strategy

- `develop` is the integration branch.
- `main` is the release branch.
- Feature branches follow `feature/<ticket>-<topic>`.

See `.claude/branch-strategy.yaml`.
